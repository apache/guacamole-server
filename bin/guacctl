# guacctl
# -------
#
# Utility for sending Guacamole-specific console codes for controlling a
# terminal session, such as:
#
#     * Downloading files (SSH only)
#     * Setting the destination directory for uploads (SSH only)
#     * Redirecting output to a named pipe stream (SSH or telnet)
#
# This script may also be run as "guacget", in which case the script accepts
# no options and assumes anything given on the commandline is a file to be
# downloaded.
#

##
## Given the name of a file, which may be a relative path, produce the full,
## real, non-relative path for that same file.

## pipe stream (instead of the terminal emulator)
##
## @param NAME
##     The name of the pipe stream to open.

guacctl 0.9.9, Guacamole terminal session control utility.
Usage: guacctl [OPTION] [FILE or NAME]...

    -d, --download         download each of the files listed.
    -s, --set-directory    set the destination directory for future uploaded 
                           files.
    -o, --open-pipe        redirect output to a new pipe stream with the given
                           name.
    -c, --close-pipe       close any existing pipe stream and redirect output
                           back to the terminal emulator.
