# Utility for sending Guacamole-specific console codes for controlling the SSH
# session, such as:
#
#     * Downloading files
#     * Setting the destination directory for uploads
#
# This script may also be run as "guacget", in which case the script accepts
# no options and assumes anything given on the commandline is a file to be
# downloaded.
#


# Given the name of a file, which may be a relative path, produce the full,
# real, non-relative path for that same file.
