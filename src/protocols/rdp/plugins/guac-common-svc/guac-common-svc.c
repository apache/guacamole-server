/**
 * Event handler for events which deal with data transmitted over an open SVC.
 * This specific implementation of the event handler currently handles only the
 * CHANNEL_EVENT_DATA_RECEIVED event, delegating actual handling of that event
 * to guac_rdp_common_svc_process_receive().
 *
 * The FreeRDP requirements for this function follow those of the
 * VirtualChannelOpenEventEx callback defined within Microsoft's RDP API:
 *
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa514754%28v%3dmsdn.10%29
 *
 * @param user_param
 *     The pointer to arbitrary data originally passed via the first parameter
 *     of the pVirtualChannelInitEx() function call when the associated channel
 *     was initialized. The pVirtualChannelInitEx() function is exposed within
 *     the channel entry points structure.
 *
 * @param open_handle
 *     The handle which identifies the channel itself, typically referred to
 *     within the FreeRDP source as OpenHandle.
 *
 * @param event
 *     An integer representing the event that should be handled. This will be
 *     either CHANNEL_EVENT_DATA_RECEIVED, CHANNEL_EVENT_WRITE_CANCELLED, or
 *     CHANNEL_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE.
 *
 * @param data
 *     The data received, for CHANNEL_EVENT_DATA_RECEIVED events, and the value
 *     passed as user data to pVirtualChannelWriteEx() for
 *     CHANNEL_EVENT_WRITE_* events (note that user data for
 *     pVirtualChannelWriteEx() as implemented by FreeRDP MUST either be NULL
 *     or a wStream containing the data written).
 *
 * @param data_length
 *     The number of bytes of event-specific data.
 *
 * @param total_length
 *     The total number of bytes expected to be received from the RDP server
 *     due to this single write (from the server's perspective). Each write may
 *     actually be split into multiple chunks, thus resulting in multiple
 *     receive events for the same logical block of data. The relationship
 *     between chunks is indicated with the CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST and
 *     CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST flags.
 *
 * @param data_flags
 *     The result of a bitwise OR of the CHANNEL_FLAG_* flags which apply to
 *     the data received. This value is relevant only to
 *     CHANNEL_EVENT_DATA_RECEIVED events. Valid flags are CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST,
 *     CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST, and CHANNEL_FLAG_ONLY. The flag CHANNEL_FLAG_MIDDLE
 *     is not itself a flag, but the absence of both CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST and
 *     CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST.
