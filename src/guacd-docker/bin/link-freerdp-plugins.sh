## @fn link-freerdp-plugins.sh
##
## Automatically creates any required symbolic links for the proper loading of
## the given FreeRDP plugins. If a given plugin is already in the correct
## directory, no link is created for that plugin.
##
## @param ...
##     The FreeRDP plugins to add links for.
##

##
## Given the full path to a FreeRDP plugin, locates the base directory of the
## associated FreeRDP installation (where the FreeRDP library .so files are
## located), printing the result to STDOUT. If the directory cannot be
## determined, an error is printed.
##
## @param PLUGIN_FILE
##     The full path to the FreeRDP plugin to check.
