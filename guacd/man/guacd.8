.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guacd
is the Guacamole proxy daemon used by the Guacamole web application and
framework. As JavaScript cannot handle binary protocols (like VNC and remote
desktop) efficiently, a new text-based protocol was developed which would
contain a common superset of the operations needed for efficient remote
desktop access, but would be easy for JavaScript programs to process.
.B guacd
is the proxy which translates between arbitrary protocols and the Guacamole
protocol.
